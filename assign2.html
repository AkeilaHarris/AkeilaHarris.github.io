            <p> As the little prince dropped off to sleep. I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. 
                <span class = "under">I felt deeply moved, and stirred. I seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span>
                <span style="background-color: orange;">It seemed to me. even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span> 
                In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: 
                <span class="red_txt">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important in invisibile..." </span> 
                As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile. I said to myself, again: 
                <span class ="red_txt"> "What moves me so deeply about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower --the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</span>
                 And I felt him to be more fraglie still. 
                <span class = "under">I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a littlepuff of wind... </span>
